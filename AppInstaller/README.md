# Package Installer sample

This sample demonstrates how to use the Package Installer API to install, upgrade and delete apps on
Android S+ devices.

## TODO
- Manual refresh button âœ…
- Fix library refresh
- Fix notifications
- Fix upgrade
- Listen to PACKAGE_ADDED
- android.intent.action.PACKAGE_ADDED
- Show lastUpdateTime in the Library
- Add explanations on how the install flow works

## What the sample does

The sample app addresses the following critical user journeys:
1. How to install apps
2. How to manually or automatically upgrade apps
3. How to uninstall apps

## What this sample does not do

- This sample does **not** download APKs from internet (which is the common way of fetching apps)
- This sample does **not** verify version code when upgrading apps, it's only overwriting the APK
- This sample does **not** handle gracefully failure at any stage. Action will be cancelled but no 
warning messages are shown to the user
