# Package Installer sample

This sample demonstrates how to use the Package Installer API to install, upgrade and delete apps on
Android S+ devices.

## What the sample does

The sample app addresses the following critical user journeys:
1. How to install apps
2. How to manually or automatically upgrade apps
3. How to uninstall apps

## What this sample does not do

- This sample does **not** download APKs from internet (which is the common way of fetching apps)
- This sample does **not** verify version code when upgrading apps, it's only overwriting the APK
- This sample does **not** handle gracefully failure at any stage. Action will be cancelled but no 
warning messages are shown to the user

## Suggested Reading

- [Package Installer API](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/content/pm/PackageInstaller)
- [setRequireUserAction method](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/android/content/pm/PackageInstaller.SessionParams#setinstallreason)

## Getting Started

This sample uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the "gradlew build" command or 
use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

## How does it work
Before being able to install applications, we need to request the ability to install app from 
unknown sources as your installer isn't pre-trusted on the device. Keep in mind that this settings
can be changed by the user only from the settings (and be updated at any time), and not via a 
runtime permission (check the `AndroidManifest.xml` of this sample to see the requested permissions).

Following the ability to install applications, we can create [PackageInstaller.Session][1] using 
[PackageInstaller.createSession][2] where we will copy the APK to be installed. Once we have a 
session ID, we open the session using [PackageInstaller.openSession][3], we write the APK bytes to 
it. We finish by calling [Session.commit][4] with a [PendingIntent][5] to be called if the install 
action requires user confirmation.

To handle install status (including [PackageInstaller.STATUS_PENDING_USER_ACTION][6]), we need to 
register a [BroadcastReceiver][7] that will listen to intents we've initialized during our session
creation. Your **BroadcastReceiver** should be registered statically in your manifest as install 
status could be sent to your app while it's closed.

Upgrading an app follows the same process, we're just overwriting the current installed app's APK by 
another one. It's your responsability to make sure you don't overwrite the installed app by an older 
version.

On Android 12+, installers that have been granted the `REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES` permission, user 
action will not be required when all of the following conditions are met:

* [setRequireUserAction][8] is set to false
* The app being installed targets **API 29** or higher
* The installer is the installer of record of an existing version of the app (in other words, this 
install session is an app update) or the installer is updating itself
* The installer declares the `UPDATE_PACKAGES_WITHOUT_USER_ACTION` permission

Note: The target API level requirement will advance in future Android versions. Session owners 
should always be prepared to handle `STATUS_PENDING_USER_ACTION`.

Uninstalling app is done by calling [PackageInstaller.uninstall][9] with the package ID of the app 
and a **PendingIntent**. A **BroadcastReceiver** should be able to receive intents from the system 
similar to the install process.
